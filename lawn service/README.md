The marketing manager for a large nationally franchised lawn service company would
like to study the characteristics that dierentiate home owners who do and do not
have a lawn service. A random sample of 30 home owners located in a suburban area
near a large city was selected. Predictor variables include household income ($K),
lawn size (square feet K), attitude toward outdoor recreational activities (1=positive,
0=negative), number of teenagers in the household, and age of the head of household.
Each student should submit answers on Canvas.
(a) Generate a scatterplot matrix of the six variables. Comment on anything unusual
or problematic.
(b) Generate a correlation matrix of the six variables. Comment on substantial cor-
relations.
(c) Fit a logistic regression of whether a household has a lawn service (lawnserv) on
the other have variables and test whether the overall regression model is significant.
(d) State the estimated regression equation
(e) Estimate the probability of purchasing a lawn service for a 45-year-old home owner
with a family income of $70K, a lawn size of 3,000 square feet, a negative attitude
towards outdoor recreation, and one teenager in the household.
(f) Which predictor variables are significantly dierent from zero (use alpha=.05)?
(g) Estimate a logistic regression model with income, attitude, and teenage as pre-
dictors. State the estimated regression equation and indicate which variables are
significant.
(h) Estimate a logistic regression model with lawnsize, attitude, and teenage as pre-
dictors. State the estimated regression equation and indicate which variables are
significant.
(i) Estimate a logistic regression model with HOH age, attitude, and teenage as
predictors. State the estimated regression equation and indicate which variables
are significant.
(j) Write a short paragraph with your final conclusions.
